          <dt>Real Tech Fluency</dt>
          <dd>You can build anything with anything, and you probably have several years
            software development experience with a couple of those years working in Ruby on Rails.
            You can learn from us, and we can learn from you.
          </dd>
          <dt>Great Communication Skills</dt>
          <dd>You aren’t just great at listening, speaking, and writing. You are
            able to convey complex ideas and information regardless of the medium or situation.</dd>
          <dt>Product-Centric Thinking</dt>
          <dd>You have opinions about how the product you’re building should
            work. You dig deep and work with customers, the company, and our executive team to uncover the ideal way to
            leverage technology to solve problems.</dd>

          <dt>Self-Directed Working Style</dt>
          <dd>Once you’ve got something, we don’t have to worry about it. You have a bias
            toward action. Our team doesn’t have QA, Project Managers, or Product Managers, so we take ownership of what we
            build.</dd>
          <dt>Respect for the Craft</dt>
          <dd>
          You build software sustainably, using modern techniques.  You are always looking for more and better
          ways to write software, and are willing to share them with your team.
          </dd>
          <dt>Respect, Empathy &amp; Humility</dt>
          <dd>You take your work seriously but not yourself. You show everyone
            respect, regardless of the circumstance. Extra points if you’re already a Stitch Fix superfan!</dd>

          <dd>We use GitHub, Heroku, HipChat, Screen Hero, and Blue Jeans to get stuff done
            online.
            We’re more interested in your personal process for collaboration than specific technologies, but are

          <dd>We're working with the usual Ruby gems like
            Rspec,
            Capybara and others for unit and feature tests and use CircleCI to bring it all together.</dd>
          <dt>Experience or interest in distributed, service-oriented architecture</dt>
          <dd>We’re using tools like RabbitMQ, ElasticSearch, and headless HTTP services to scale
          our team and software.  We’re learning as we go, so your experience or keen interest
          can ensure our systems handle our ever-increasing load.
