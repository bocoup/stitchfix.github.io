    <p>
    Stitch Fix is making its first foray into mobile and we’re looking for a great engineering leader to help us get there.  
    As the first mobile hire, you will be responsible for all aspects of mobile development, from product definition to technical architecture and design.  
    Stitch Fix is a different kind of company where we think the people actually doing the work are the ones who are best suited to decide what to build.  
    As such, we don’t have a product management discipline.  Instead, we expect our engineers to make critical decisions around product development.  
    If you want to come build new products and solve interesting problems with a great group of people, we're looking for more excited and talented individuals to join us.
