    <p>Stitch Fix is forging a new business model and we have some of the best
        data alchemists to drive it. We are an ensemble of high-caliber
        scientists and engineers with expertise ranging from physics,
        neuroscience, to mathematics who are curious thinkers with
        get-things-done built into their DNA. The data we work on, the results,
        and products are some of Stitch Fixâ€™s key ingredients.</p>

        <h4 class="h4">What you will do</h4>
    </header>
    <p>In this role you will build a data science platform that can reliably
        scale to the needs of our data scientists, algorithms developers, and
        growing business. You will have the opportunity to help guide decision
        making and development at all layers of the data platform. This includes
        choosing and deploying compute infrastructure (e.g. Hadoop, Spark,
        Redshift), building frameworks designed to speed up and facilitate
        algorithm development, and developing a micro-service architecture
        designed to democratize data to everyone in the organization.
