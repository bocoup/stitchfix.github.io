      <h4 class="h4">The Role</h4>
      <p>
        Stitch Fix has an extensive internal platform for managing our business, from inventory management to warehouse logistics to our own Personal Styling platform, each serving thousands of internal users who run the business every day.  Our public-facing infrastructure is growing as well, helping millions of our customers be their best selves.  It’s all tied together with an array of user-facing applications and back-end services.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re ops savvy, but not ops-focused. While we are currently hosting our Rails apps on Heroku and leveraging their add-on ecosystem, we are only married to what works, and are constantly re-evaluating our technical infrastructure.  We aren’t afraid of change if that helps us deliver faster, better, and more reliable solutions to our business partners and customers. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where you come in.  You’re ops-focused and developer-savvy. You’re ready to build the technical operations platform that will carry us for the next three years.  You can think strategically about our technical operations, define where we need to be by partnering with the engineering team. You can get hands-on to build and deploy what we need, eventually building & leading a team to help you.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’ve always wanted to build a top-notch technical operations platform, this is the job for you.  If your idea of technical operations is tools, developer agency, and partnership—instead of tickets and pagers—this is the job for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the role you will:
        <ul>
          <li>Develop a long-term view of technical operations at Stitch Fix</li>
          <li>Partner with Engineering to define what “DevOps” means to us</li>
          <li>Own the relationships with our vendors and develop new ones</li>
          <li>Architect, plan, and build the operations platform to make our engineering team successful</li>
          <li>Advocate for technical operations as we grow our business</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally, you:
        <ul>
          <li>Have strong experience with Ruby on Rails deployment and operations</li>
          <li>Have experience maintaining and supporting data stores like Postgres and Redis</li>
          <li>Have experience with cloud hosting/platform-as-a-service</li>
          <li>Have experience with the latest operations automation tools (e.g. chef, puppet)</li>
          <li>Have worked closely with engineers, partnering on cross-functional projects</li>
          <li>Can prioritize and execute high-value, high-impact projects</li>
          <li>Can write code to get things done, but also build a small team to share the load.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
